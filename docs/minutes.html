                            First we discussed and wrote up the contract that every member of our team must agree to.
                            Started working on website details. We discussed links weâ€™d like to include such as Team
                            information and Team Contract. We also created a poll to check when everyone is free to make
                            up for the lab we will be missing next week.

                            With Lab 2 approaching, we decided that Nick and Ben would go into the lab today (9/8)
                            at 4:30 pm to get a head start on the acoustic part Lab 2. We also decided that Raul and
                            possibly Ryan would meet in the lab tomorrow (9/9) at 3 pm to get a head start on the optical
                            part of Lab 2. We then discussed scheduling another set time for a team meeting every week, and
                            the consensus was meeting at the open lab on Tuesdays at 4:15 pm. Finally, we brought up the
                            idea of changing our team name.

                            First, we decided on some updates to our team contract. We then decided that Nick and Ben would
                            go into the lab today (9/15) at 4:30 pm to finish up the acoustic part of Lab 2. We also laid
                            out the list of tasks we needed to complete in order to meet Milestone 1. We were also able to
                            start our Lab 2 write-up. Lastly, we decided on our new team name.
