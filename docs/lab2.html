                            The next step in developing our robot is to allow it to sense the world around it.
                            Our robot can currently move throughout its environment, but has no knowledge about
                            where it is or what is around it. For this lab, we developed two different sensors to be used on our robot.
                            First, we used a microphone circuit to detect a 660Hz whistle blow.
                            This tone is used to signal our robot to begin exploring the maze.
                            The second sensor was an IR sensor to detect various treasures which blink at varying frequencies.

                            In order to analyze analog signals, it is often easy and useful to tranform them into the frequency
                            domain from the time domain. This then allows us to examine the dominate frequencies contributing to
                            a particular signal.

                            Luckily the arduino architecture has a large amount of open source third party code available for use.
                            For this lab, we used Open Music Labs' FFT library to perform fourier transforms on our sensor data.
                            Because this library is from a third party and is not included with the Arduino IDE download, we had
                            to download the source code and place it in our libraries directory. Code and documentation of Open
                            Music Labs FFT can be found <a href="http://wiki.openmusiclabs.com/wiki/ArduinoFFT">here</a>. Below is
                            a command prompt showing the tree structure of the FFT library we downloaded.

                            The setup function for this code mainly deals with setting up the analog to digital converter.
                            In the last lab, we used the provided function <code class="cpp">analogRead()</code> to get an
                            analog value from an analog input pin. However, the documentation for this function state that
                            the execution time is approximately 100 microseconds (.0001 s). Therefore, the maximum sampling
                            rate is approximately 10,000 Hz. Because we are trying to detect infrared signals up to 14 kHz,
                            this is simply not fast enough. Therefore, we have to read the value directly from the analog to
                            digital converter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Within the loop function above, 256 samples are fetched from the ADC, and placed into even bins.
                            When computing a fourier transform, there will be real and imaginary components. For the FFT library,
                            even bins correspond to the real part, and odd bins correspond to the imaginary part. Since we are
                            dealing with real signals, we will only write to and read from the even bins. Once all of the bins have
                            been filled, You must process the data using <code class="cpp">fft_run()</code>. For the purposes of
                            this example, the bins are then outputted to the serial monitor. This code served as the basis
                            for the development of both the acoustic and optic sensors.

                        <p>
                            We began by wiring together a circuit to detect varying levels of
                            infrared light. The sensor in this circuit is a photoresistor which will
                            pass varying amounts of current through it depending on the amount of infrared
                            light hitting it. We convert this variable current to a variable voltage by passing
                            it through a resistor. Below is a simple schematic diagraming the basic circuit
                            setup. Vout is them used as the analog input for the Arduino.

                        Once we had our circuit built, we began testing using the treasures. Borrowing a treasure from on of
                        the TA's, we began by measuring the signal directly using the oscilloscope. By adjusting the
                        pontentiometers on the treasure board, we were able to change the frequency and intensity of the
                        infrared signal. Below is a screen capture of the oscilloscope. Note that the signal resembles the
                        charge and discharge of a capacitor more than a standard sine wave. Because of this, the signal will
                        contain a range of frequency components, however, the one we are interested in is the main tone. In this case,
                        the treasure is tuned to about 7.4 kHz.

                            Now that we had our circuit built and tested the treasure board, we were ready to begin processing the
                            signals using the Arduino. First, we passed the output of our sensor circuit through a 300 Ohm resistor,
                            and into an analog input pin on the Arduino. We then wrote a program to read in the data, and perform a
                            fourier transform to determine the dominant frequency components.

                            In order to analyze the data from the FFT, you need to know what each bin corresponds to.
                            This depends on the sampling frequency. In order to spped up the sampling frequency, you
                            must read the value directly from the ADC. The sampling frequency can then be changed by
                            changing the clock prescalar for the ADC clock. By default, the ADC clock is 16 MHz with
                            a default prescalar of 128. Therefore, the ADC clock is 16 MHz/128 = 125 KHz. Since a
                            conversion takes 13 ADC clock cycles, the default sample rate is 125 KHz/13 = 9600 Hz.
                            This sampling rate is not quite fast enough for our purpose, so we adjusted the prescalar
                            to 64 to produce a sampling frequency of approximmately 19.2 KHz. In order to do this, we
                            set the ADPS register to 110. Note, the below code adjusts the ADC clock prescalar as described,
                            but we also generate a square wave with half this frequency on I/O pin 11. This was done to check
                            the sampling frequency since at the time of the lab we were unable to find good documentation on
                            the ADC clock and sampling frequencies.

                            This code simply dumps the data from all of the even bins to the serial monitor.
                            We then took this data, and graphed it to see the various frequency components.
                            Below is the oscilloscope waveform for two different frequencies from the treasure board.
                            The voltage for these waveforms is taken at the anolog input to the arduino, therefore, it
                            represents the voltage across the resistor in our infrared sensor circuit.

                            Below is a graph of the corresponding frequency components for each signal. We included an FFT
                            for data which was recorded with no treasure signal. This is useful to tell what the background IR
                            signal is like.

                            From these FFT's, it is easy to distinguish which signal corresponds to the 7 KHz treasure, and which
                            one corresponds to the 12 KHz signal. For all signals, there is a large DC component, while most of
                            the higher frequency components remain under 50. The two larger peaks at 7 KHz and 12 KHz shows that these
                            two signals have a large contribution from these frequencies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once we were able to see the effect of varying signal frequencies on the FFT, we decided to investigate
                            how the distance to the treasure affected the FFT. Below is another FFT graph showing two separate signals.
                            The first signal was taken with the treasure approximately 2 inches from the sensor while the second signal was
                            taken with the treasure approximately 7 inches from the sensor.

                            While there is still a peak at 7 KHz, the farther signal is much weaker, and the peak is harder to distinguish.
