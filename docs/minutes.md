### 9/1/17

First we discussed and wrote up the contract that every member of our team must agree to. Started working on website details. We discussed links weâ€™d like to include such as Team information and Team Contract. We also created a poll to check when everyone is free to make up for the lab we will be missing next week. 

No members were absent. 

### 9/8/17

With Lab 2 approaching, we decided that Nick and Ben would go into the lab today (9/8) at 4:30 pm to get a head start on the acoustic part Lab 2. We also decided that Raul and possibly Ryan would meet in the lab tomorrow (9/9) at 3 pm to get a head start on the optical part of Lab 2. We then discussed scheduling another set time for a team meeting every week, and the consensus was meeting at the open lab on Tuesdays at 4:15 pm. Finally, we brought up the idea of changing our team name.

### 9/15/17
