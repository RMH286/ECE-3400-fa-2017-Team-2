                            First we discussed and wrote up the contract that every member of our team must agree to.
                            Started working on website details. We discussed links weâ€™d like to include such as Team
                            information and Team Contract. We also created a poll to check when everyone is free to make
                            up for the lab we will be missing next week.

                            With Lab 2 approaching, we decided that Nick and Ben would go into the lab today (9/8)
                            at 4:30 pm to get a head start on the acoustic part Lab 2. We also decided that Raul and
                            possibly Ryan would meet in the lab tomorrow (9/9) at 3 pm to get a head start on the optical
                            part of Lab 2. We then discussed scheduling another set time for a team meeting every week, and
                            the consensus was meeting at the open lab on Tuesdays at 4:15 pm. Finally, we brought up the
                            idea of changing our team name.

                            go into the lab today (9/15) at 4:30 pm to finish up the acoustic part of Lab 2. We also laid
                            out the list of tasks we needed to complete in order to meet Milestone 1. We were also able to
                            start our Lab 2 write-up. Lastly, we decided on our new team name.

                            discussed some design ideas for various aspects of the robot, such as judiciously using the
                            analog pins on our arduino and laying out the wall detection sensors. Finally, we decided to
                            meet in the lab on Saturday (9/23) to work on the Milestone 2 tasks.

                            and to work on implementing a multiplexer for the analog inputs to our arduino.
                            We then discussed making a new chassis for our robot and the overall layout of our
                            robot, with the intention of making the robot neater and more organized. We also
                            discussed if we want to buy any parts for the robot, such as new motors or better
                            sensors.

                            First, we decided to go into the lab tomorrow (10/14) to get more work done on Lab
                            3. We then discussed the idea of making a PCB for our robot, since we are getting a
                            more complete idea of all the circuitry that we'll need. Finally, we discussed the
                            timeline of finishing lab 3 and starting lab 4.

                            Since we feel we now have a good understanding of many of the sub-components of the robot,
                            we decided to discuss how to bring all the sub-components together. Specifically, we
                            discussed the best way to handle all of the analog inputs to the Arduino (line sensors,
                            wall sensors, treasure detectors). We started thinking about maze traversal algorithms
                            and the amount of data needed to completely map the maze. We also briefly talked about
                            implementing SPI for serial communication between the Arduino and FPGA. Finally, we decided
                            to go into the lab tomorrow (10/21) to work on lab 4 and the multiplexer.

                            First, we discussed the work that we need to get done for Milestone 3, implementing a
                            working algorithm to facilitate maze exploration in simulation and in real life. We decided
                            to try implementing the simulation portion using python. Now that we have a better idea of
                            the final design of our robot, we also discussed starting the robot design page on the
                            website in order to formally document our design.

                            First, we discussed the remaining work that needs to be completed for Milestone 3, like adding
                            a done signal to our simulation and implementing the maze traversal algorithm in the Arduino
                            IDE. We decided to go into the lab tomorrow (11/4) to continue working on Milestone 3. We also
                            thought about our general work schedule leading up to Thanksgiving break, with Milestones 3
                            and 4 in mind.

                            We decided to go to open lab tomorrow (11/11) to work on the tasks we need to accomplish for
                            Milestone 4. We identified the following tasks to complete: Fix multiplexer connected to IR
                            wall sensors, Verify implementation of maze traversal algorithm on Arduino, Fix op amp circuit
                            for amplification of treasure signals and start signal, Ensure real-time maze data can properly
                            be sent between two Arduino's using the wireless radios, and Ensure FPGA can update VGA display
                            accordingly.

                            We discussed the work that still needs to be done for Milestone 4, including mounting the
                            treasure sensors on the robot, fixing the maze traversal algorithm, and getting the FPGA to
                            properly update the VGA display. We also looked into what open lab times we could make it to
                            later in the week to continue working, after our lab time today.
