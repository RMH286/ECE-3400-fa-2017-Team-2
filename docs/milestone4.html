                                For this milestone, we needed to have a system that displays both the walls and the treasures
                                in a maze as the robot finds them. Additionally, we needed our system to display a "done"
                                signal on the screen and play a "done" tune on the speaker when the maze had been mapped
                                completely.

                            In the previous milestone, we discussed how our mux was working improperly and not outputting the correct values. Turns out, we forgot to 
                            initialize the pinmode of the digital pins used for the select signal and that was causing incorrect readings. With this simple fix, our muxes work properly.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                            Another issue we came accross while working on this milestone was an inadequate number of digital pins. In our previous design, we had decided to use 
                            two muxes, one for the wall sensors and one for the treasure sensors. This meant we needed digital pins for each select signal. Our radio already takes 
                            up digital pins 9-12 and that cannot be changed as those pins are required for SPI communication. We also needed pins for the LEDs to show which frequency
                            of treasure we have found. Each servo takes up a digital PWM pin as well. Due to our limited amount of digital pins (only 5 left after the radio and servos
                            are plugged in), we decided to simply use one mux for both the treasure and wall sensors. We needed 3 digital select bits for the 8 to 1 mux and the remaining 
                            2 digital pins are used for the LEDs. The select signal and which signal they correspond with is as follows:

                            We positioned 3 treasure sensors on the left, front and right sides of our robot. 

                            Our treasure sensor code from lab 2 only needed minor changes when incorporating it into our main algorithm. We created two 
                            different functions for our main code. The first is called detect_treasure() and returns a character. This character 
                            signifies if there is no treasure (returns 0), the treasure is 7kHz (returns 1), the treasure is 12 kHz (returns 2) or 
                            the treasure is 17 kHz (returns 3). This function also iterates through each of the select bits as follows in order to 
                            check all 3 sensors. 
                            <pre><code>
                            			digitalWrite(s2, HIGH);
							  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
							    digitalWrite(s0, LOW);
							    digitalWrite(s1, LOW);
							    if (i & 1) {
							      digitalWrite(s0, HIGH);
							    }
							    if (i & 2) {
							      digitalWrite(s1, HIGH);
							    }
                            </code></pre><br />


                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The biggest change we needed to make to our treasure sensor code was the number of bins we were using. We originally defined
                            FFT_N as 256, but quickly realized this takes up a lot of memory on the arduino and would potentially cause issues. In order
                            to fix this, we reduced the amount of bins from 256 to 128. Becuase the bins were now of different widths and contained different
                            frequencies, we analyzed the bin outputs when a treasure of each frequency was present. We knew the bin numbers that we should
                            be checking would be around half the bin number of the original bins we checked. Below is an example of a graph of the sensor
                            output vs. the bin number when a 12 kHz treasure is present. 
                            <center>
                            <a href="#">
                                <img src="assets/images/IR12khz.png" alt="" style="width:512px;" />
                            </a>
                        	</center>
                        	Based on this graph, we chose to check if bins 40, 41 and 42 were all above 60. We repeated this process for the 7kHz and 17kHz
                        	treasures and produced the following code for detect_treasure()
                        	<pre><code>
                        				int seven = fft_log_out[24] + fft_log_out[25];
						    int twelve = fft_log_out[40] + fft_log_out[41] + fft_log_out[42];
						    int seventeen = fft_log_out[57] + fft_log_out[58] + fft_log_out[59];
						    
						    if (seven > 120){
						      treasure = 1;
						    }

						    else if (twelve > 180){
						      treasure = 2;
						    }

						    else if (seventeen > 180){
						      treasure = 3;
						    }
						    if (treasure != 0) {
						      ADCSRA = 0xc0; //turn off free running mode
						      return treasure;
						    }
						  }
						  ADCSRA = 0xc0; // Turn off free running mode
						  return treasure;

                        	</code></pre><br />

                        	You will also notice that at the end of our code, we needed to reset the ADCSRA so that we were not in free running mode and 
                        	could use analogRead for the rest of our main code. The next function we wrote was checkTreasure(). This function turns 
                        	on the appropriate LED and updates the current maze squre to reflect that there is a specific treasure present in that square
                        	of the maze. Each position in the maze is represented as a single byte and bits 6 and 7 represent treasures. If those bits are 00,

                            Our Radio code was very similar to the radio code from lab 4, we just needed to change the data we were sending.
                            We chose to send two bytes of information after every time we reach a junction and check for walls and treasures.
                            The first byte characterizes the current sqaure the robot is in and is as follows:
                            <style>

		                                </tr>

		                                    <td>Treasure bit 1</td>
		                                    <td>Treasure bit 0</td>

		                                    <td>unreachable</td>
		                                    <td>West wall present</td>

		                            </table>
		                        </center>

		                    We define the north wall as the wall in the direction the robot starts the maze. We assume the robot starts the maze in the 
		                    bottom right corner.
		                    The second byte is used the represent which row and column the robot is in and is as follows:

		                        </center>
		                    In our main algorithm, each sqaure in the maze is already an 8 bit character that follows the 
		                    structure of the first byte. We have a function that takes in that byte, the current row and 
		                    the current column and then sends this information to the arduino at the base station. We store 
		                    the two bytes in the variable data_buffer. That function is as 
		                    follows:
		                    <pre><code>
		                    bool transmit_node(char node, int row, int column){
							  char data_buffer[2];
							  row = row<<3;
							  char coords = row | column;
							  data_buffer[0] = node;
							  data_buffer[1] = coords;
							 
							  // First, stop listening so we can talk.
							  radio.stopListening();

							  // Take the time, and send it.  This will block until complete
							    
							  bool ok = radio.write( data_buffer, 2 );

							  if (!ok){
							    return false;
							  }

							  // Now, continue listening
							  radio.startListening();

							  // Wait here until we get a response, or timeout (250ms)
							  unsigned long started_waiting_at = millis();
							  bool timeout = false;
							  while ( ! radio.available() && ! timeout )
							    if (millis() - started_waiting_at > 200 )
							      timeout = true;

							  // Describe the results
							  if ( timeout )
							  {
							    return false;
							  }
							  else
							  {
							    // Grab the response, compare, and send to debugging spew
							    char got_data[2];
							    radio.read( &got_data, 2 );
							    if(got_data[0]!=data_buffer[0] | got_data[1]!=data_buffer[1]){
							      return false;
							    }

							  }

							}
		                    </code></pre><br />

		                    In the main code, if the function returns false when called, we send the data again.

                            The main loop of our alrgorithm calls functions to check for walls, check for treasures and then 
                            move to a new node in the maze. At each junction, we send information about that square to the base station. 
                            Once the entire maze has been traversed and mapped, the blue and green LEDs alternate flashing on and off.
                            The main loop of our algorithm is as follows:

                            In order to recieve the bytes sent from the robot, we need an arduino with the radio on digital pins 9-13. 
                            We also need to use SPI to communicate with the FPGA. To do this the FPGA has to also be hooked up to the 
                            clock, MISO and MOSI lines that the radio is on (pins 13, 12, and 11 respectively). We also needed another 
                            select pin for the FPGA which we chose to be digital pin 4. In order to read in SPI data from the radio,
                            pin 10 needs to be set low and pin 4 needs to be set high. In order to transmit information to the fpga, 
                            pin 10 needs to be high and 4 needs to be low. All the pins connected to the FPGA must also go through
                            a voltage divider first to step the voltage down from 5V to 3.3V by using 330 Ohm and 680 Ohm resistors.
                            The picture below illustrates the radio receiver and pin 4 from the Arduino passing through a voltage divider
                            into the inputs of the FPGA.

                            <pre><code>

							      delay(20);

							    }

							    // First, stop listening so we can talk
							    radio.stopListening();

							    // Send the final one back.

							    //switch to FPGA and send data

							    digitalWrite(SS, LOW);
							    SPI.transfer(got_data[2]);
							    digitalWrite(SS, HIGH);

							    // Now, resume listening so we catch the next packets.

                            Our main objective was to devise a method to display the entire maze including walls, treasures, and the path itself. In order to acheive this goal, our 4x5 maze is
                            defined by small 10x10 pixel squares. The 4x5 grid is mapped to a 36x46 grid by decomposing each original grid spacing into a thin 10x10 pixel boarder representing of the possible
                            walls around the node. The conglomerate of remaining squares on the inside of the boarder represents a node where our robot is able to travel within the maze. We use red to indicate unvisited
                            portions of the maze, green to indicate the current position of the robot, black for walls, and three different colors corresponding to the three treasures we might encounter in the maze.
