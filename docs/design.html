                        <p>
                        We were asked to design and build a robot capable of solving and mapping a maze autonomously, starting after a sound signal is given. This information needs to be sent back to our base station to be displayed on a monitor, and once done play a done signal through the speakers.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        The maze consisted of a 4x5 grid marked with black tape lines which the robot must follow, for which we used line sensors. The grid is surrounded by wooden walls, as well as some inside to form the maze, for which we used short range wall sensors for the robot to detect them and avoid running into them. And lastly treasures, which each emit a frequency of either 7kHz, 12kHz, or 17kHz. To detect these, we used IR sensors.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        The base station needs to receive the signals, and display the proper image on the monitor. It should display where the robot is currently at, where it has been, where there is a wall, where there is a treasure (Frequency of the treasure must also be distinguishable), and some sort of done signal, as well as  playing the done signal as aforementioned.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        Our robot will compete with other robots to complete the task. Which means we not only need to make it accurate, but also fast. To achieve this, we need to optimize the physical design of the robot as well as the code and maze solving algorithm  as much as we can.

                                The final version of our robot included the following components:
                                <center>
                                <ul>

                                    <li>1 Arduino Uno</li>
                                    <li>1 Microphone</li>
                                    <li>1 Eight to One Multiplexer</li>
                                    <li>1 Push Button</li>
                                    <li>1 Radio</li>
                                    <li>1 5V Power Bank</li>

                                </center>
                                The Arduino is the microcontroller that takes in data from all of the sensors, processes our algorithm and controls the servos that move our robot. The microphone and push button are used to start the robot. Either a specific tone is heard by the microphone or the button is pressed to begin the maze mapping. The multiplexer is used to select between 7 different signals: the 3 wall sensors, the 3 treasure sensors or the microphone. The radio is used to communicate the maze information to the base station which displays the maze. Every sensor, servo and the microcontroller is powered by the power bank.

                                The four line sensors, used to line follow, were placed just a few centimeters above the ground in the front of our robot. Below is a picture of the labeling each of the line sensors.

                                The middle two, reffered to as the "front left" and "front right" line sensors are used mainly to detect the black lines to follow throughout the maze and ensure we continue to follow them. The outer 2, reffered to as the "back left" and "back right" line sensors, are used to detect junctions within the maze.     
                            </p>

                                The short range IR sensors are placed on the front and sides of the robot to detect walls in front of, to the right of, or to the left of the robot while it is traversing the maze. The 3 IR treasure sensors are also placed on the front and sides of the robot to detect treasures. Pictured below is our final version of our robot.

                                Towards the end of the semster, as more and more boards and sensors were placed on our robot, we realized we had a weight issue. Our robot's weight was concentrated too far back and would cause the front of our robot to pop up every time it accelerated from a stop. To counteract this, we added washers the front of our robot. In the future we would have liked to clean up this design. If given more time, we would have designed a printed circuit board (PCB) to clean up wiring. This would have allowed us to use just a single level chasis, also taking care of our weight distrubution issue.

                                Before we begin discussing the details of our algorithm, we will first lay out the variable declarations as well as particular initializations used in the setup section of our code. We kept track of our maze using a 5 by 4 array of one byte characters, maze. Each character corresponds to the information about one square in the maze. We usee maze[current_row][current_column] to index into the array and access the information about a sqare. Each bit in the character represents a certain characteristic of that square as follows:

                                In order to keep track of the current direction the robot is facing, we used an enumeration with values north, south, east and west. North corresponds to the direction we place the robot down in originally and the direction is initalized as such.

                                    Our algorithm also needs a way to keep a backtrack que whenever the robot reaches a square with no more possible unvisited squares to move to. We use an array of size 20 to store our backtrack que which is comprised of directions to move in if we must backtrack. An int, backtrack_pointer, is ued to index into the correct value in this array. A 5 by 4 array of ints is used mark reachable squares that are still unvisited and is used to tell if when our robot has finished mapping the entire maze. This array is called possible_moves_maze.

                                    The setup function of our code initialzes all the pins used as well the servos. For the competition, every robot started in the bottom right corner of the maze so the current row and current column were initialzed to 4 and 3 respectively (the row and column values begin at 0). We also initialize maze[4][3] to be visited and to have a south wall, since we know our robot will be starting with a wall directly behind it.

                            The main loop of our code begins with a while loop that is only broken out of if a 660 Hz tone is detected by the microphone or the button is pressed. We then update our current node and then move into a while loop that continues to update each node as long as there is a possible move towards an unvisited node or there are still unvisted and reachable nodes in the possible_moves_maze array. Once we've traveled to every reachable node, we transmit a done signal to the base station. The main loop is as follows:
                            <pre><code>
                            void loop() {

                            The detect_tone() function uses the FFT library which outputs values for each bin number. In a previous lab we chose to iterate through 256 bins, but in order to save memory on the arduino, we reudced this amount to 128 bins. By printing out the values of each bin, we found that the 660Hz tone now caused a peak in bin 15. We check if this bin is produces a value over 75 to determine if the tone is being played.

                            <pre><code>

                            The update_node() function checks all the walls around the robot when it is at a junction and updates the corresponding bits in the maze array. The function also checks for treasures and then transmits the fully updated byte of information along with the current row and current column of the robot to the base station.

                            The functions used to detect walls (left_wall(), front_wall(), and right_wall()), all follow the same structure with the only difference being which mux select signals to set high or low. The wall sensors work by sending values betweeon 0 and 1023 with higher numbers corresponding to closer objects being detected. We found that a threshold of 250 worked well for determining if a wall was detected or not. Below is one of the three wall detection functions:
                            <pre><code>
                            bool left_wall() {

                            The detect_treasure() function is similar to the detect_tone() function in that it also uses the FFT library. The main difference is that the sampling frequency must be changed since the default is too slow to detect the treasure frequencies of 7kHZ, 12kHz, and 14kHz. In order to speed up the sampling frequency, you must read the value directly from the ADC. The sampling frequency can then be changed by changing the clock prescalar for the ADC clock. By default, the ADC clock is 16 MHz with a default prescalar of 128. Therefore, the ADC clock is 16 MHz/128 = 125 KHz. Since a conversion takes 13 ADC clock cycles, the default sample rate is 125 KHz/13 = 9600 Hz. This sampling rate is not quite fast enough for our purpose, so we adjusted the prescalar to 64 to produce a sampling frequency of approximmately 19.2 KHz. In order to do this, we set the ADPS register to 110. Note, the detect_treasure() function adjusts the ADC clock prescalar as described, but first stores all the changed registers in temporary values so that they can be reset at the end of the function. If we do not do this, we will not be able to use the analogRead() function throughout the rest of our code. Since we also decreased the number of bins from 128 to 256 as we did in the microphone code, we needed to change the bin numbers we checked. Below is an image of the FFT values plotted as a function of bin number when a 12 kHz treasure is present. We used these plots to determine the bin numbers to check for all desired treasure frequencies.

                            The tresure function outputs an int that corresponds to the treasure frequency. Zero corresponds with no treasure, one is 7kHz, two is 12kHz, and 3 is 17kHz. Below is the full detect_treausre() function:

                            Each of the four possible moving functions (move_north(), move_south(), move_east(), and move_west()) determine, based on the current robot direction, how many left or right turns to make and then move the robot forward until reaching the next junction. Those functions also update the robots direction, the backtrack que, the backtrack pointer and the maze array with the correct values. Below is the function for move_north(). You will notice the opposite direction, south, is added to the backtrack que. This is so that when we are backtracking, we simply have to iterate through the array, moving in the direction that is stored in order to move backwards.

                            The next_move() function determines which of these functions to call by identifying which directions the robot can move in order to reach an unvisited node that is not blocked by a wall. The possible_moves array stores which direction (north, south, east or west) is a possible move to an unvisited node. Every possible move to an unvisited node is added to the possible_moves array so that we can keep track of when the robot has finished mapping the maze. If there is not a reachable unvisited node, then the last element of possible_moves is set to one to signify that the robot needs to backtrack.

                            To determine the best move, the best_move() function first checks if the robot is done mapping the maze. If we need to backtrack but the possible_moves array shows only zeros, then the robot is done. Otherwise, the robot iterates through the backtrack que, moving in the direction stored in the array. If the robot is not backtracking, then we always chose the best move to be in the same direction as the current robot direction if possible. If not then the robot turns right. If the robot can't turn right, it turns around (which should never actually happen since the node behind us should be already visited.) If it doesn't turn around, then it turn lefts.

                            All the above functions make up the core of our algorithm in determining where to go at each junction and keeping track of all relevent information. These functions individually work well, but certain fucntions, such as the detect_tone() and detect_treasure() fucntions experience issues when incorporated into our code. These issues, our methods in attempting to resolve them and how we would fix them in the future is dicussed in the Unresolved Issues section below.

                        <p>
                            While the previous functions dealt with the logic of our algorithm, the following functions we will discuss focus around the physical movement and control of the servos to ensure smooth line following and consistent junction detection. The most important function dealing with the smoothness of our robot is the move_forward() function. The fucntion reads in data from the front and left line sensors to detect whetehr they are over the black line or not. We found that any value over 800 is consistent with line sensors postioned directly above the black line. If the right one has moved off the line, then we want to adjust by turning left, so we write the right wheel to full speed and stop the left wheel. The opposited occurs if the left line sensor has moved off the line. The robot keeps correcting until both line sensors are over the black line. We stratigically placed our front right and left line sensors separated by the width of the tape so that we immediately detect any vearing off the line and correct it. The move forward function also continues the movement until a junction is detected and then proceeds to step slightly past the junction. It is important to note that, since the wheels servos are mounted in a mirrored fashion, the values written to the servos to move forward at maximum speed are oposite (0 for the right wheel and 180 for the left). Both wheels stop when written to a value of 90. Below is the move forward function.
                            <pre><code>
                            void move_forward() {
                                  while (!detect_junction()) {
                                    int fr = analogRead(fr_linepin);
                                    int fl = analogRead(fl_linepin);

                                    if (fr > 800 && fl < 800) {
                                      right_pwm = 90;
                                    }
                                    else if (fr < 800 && fl > 800) {
                                      left_pwm = 90;
                                    }
                                    else {
                                      right_pwm = 0;
                                      left_pwm = 180;
                                    }
                                    right_wheel.write(right_pwm);
                                    left_wheel.write(left_pwm);
                                  }
                                  step_past_junction();
                                }

                            The detect_junction() function simply reads the values of the back right and back left line sensors and returns true if they ever over 800, meaning they have detected a black line. The positioning of the back right and left line sensors is also imperative. They must be far enough way from the middle as to not detect a junction if the robot vears slightly off the black line. Below is the detect_junction() function:
                            <pre><code>
                            bool detect_junction() {
                                  int br = analogRead(br_linepin);
                                  int bl = analogRead(bl_linepin);
                                  if (br > 800 && bl > 800) {
                                    Serial.println("detect junction");
                                    return true;
                                  }
                                  return false;
                                }
                            </code></pre><br />

                            The step_past_junction() function moves the robot forward past a junction until the back right and left line sensors are no longer over the black line. The purpose of this function is to improve the accuracy of our turning. By stepping past, the robots center of rotation more closely matches the center of the junction, allowing to turn directly over the junction and continue onto the next line more smoothly. The stepping_past_junction() is as follows:
                            <pre><code>
                            void step_past_junction() {
                                  right_wheel.write(0);
                                  left_wheel.write(180);
                                  int br = analogRead(br_linepin);
                                  int bl = analogRead(bl_linepin);
                                  while (br > 800 || bl > 800) {
                                    br = analogRead(br_linepin);
                                    bl = analogRead(bl_linepin);
                                  }
                                  right_wheel.write(90);
                                  left_wheel.write(90);
                                }

                            The turning functions, turn_left() and turn_right() simply write values to the wheels to make them move in opposite directions. For example, to turn left, the right wheel is written to 0 in order to move forward and the left wheel is written to 0 in order to move backwards. This allows the robot to turn quickly and in place over the junction. The turn ends when both the front right and left line sensors are over the black line again. Below is the turn_left() function:
                            <pre><code>
                            void turn_left() {
                                  Serial.println("turning left");
                                  left_wheel.write(0);
                                  right_wheel.write(0);
                                  int fr = analogRead(fr_linepin);
                                  int fl = analogRead(fl_linepin);
                                  while (fr > 800 || fl > 800) {
                                    fr = analogRead(fr_linepin);
                                    fl = analogRead(fl_linepin);
                                  }
                                  while (fr < 800 || fl < 800) {
                                    fr = analogRead(fr_linepin);
                                    fl = analogRead(fl_linepin);
                                  }
                                  left_wheel.write(90);
                                  right_wheel.write(90);
                                }

                        <p>Unfortately, we could not get every facet of our code working together for the final competition. Our microphone code, used to start the robot at the sound of a 660Hz tone, malfunctioned whenever used at the same time as our wall sensors. When simply running the detect_tone() function, we recieved accurate values with very little noise. However, once the wall sensors were introduced, the values would spike, introducing a lot of noise, making it impossible to detect the tone. We decided to, for the competition, simply start the robot with the push botton. Originally we planned on having an op amp combined with a band-pass filter in order to fix these issues, but, due to time constraints, were never able to. In the future, we would have liked to implement a filter similar to the one shown below:
                            <center>
                            <a href="#">
                                <img src="assets/images/amplifier.png" alt="" style="width:512px;" />
                            </a>
                            </center>
                        Another portion of our code that we could not get to function properly is the treasure sensor code. Again, when just running the treasure sensor code, we recieved accurate values and detected all three frequencies. When added to our full algorithm we started seeing some odd behavior. Whenever the treasure sensor function was called, our arduino would reset completely, returning to the while loop that required the button to be pressed to start again. Our inclination was that there must be a hardware wiring issue if the arduino is resetting. An arduino reset could be due to a short in the system, although we checked all the connections and could not find any. Another possible reason for this error could be due to us resetting the ADC registers within the treasure code. Although we do not believe reassinging these values would cause a reset of the arduino, more research would need to be done to find the root of the problem. 
                        </p>
                        <p> In order to improve the efficiency of our alogorithm, in the future we would have adjusted the backtracking. A faster way to backtrack to any unvisited nodes is to find the direct path from the current robot location to the closest unvisited node. This would cut down a significant amount of time when mapping the full maze. Another way to optimize the algorithm is to implement something closer to Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. All reachable nodes would be stored and the closest one to get to would be visited first. This would probably reduce the amount of nodes that we would need to revisit in order to map the entire maze.

                            The FPGA was the single most important component of our base station. First, it needed to be able to communicate with
                            our base station's Arduino, which would be receiving maze information from our robot via the wireless radios. Second,
                            it needed to act as the driver for the VGA monitor that we needed to display the maze on. The FPGA also acted as the
                            platform upon which our logic to update the VGA display in real-time was stored. Additionally, the FPGA needed to
                            output an audio tune to the speakers to play when the robot finished mapping the maze.

                        <p>
                            As we discussed for Milestone 4, we decided to use the SPI serial communication protocol to facilitate communication
                            between the Base Station Arduino and the FPGA. To recap what was mentioned then, we needed four connection lines
                            between the Arduino and the FPGA: clock (SCK), MOSI (master-out, slave-in), MISO (master-in, slave-out), and
                            slave-select (SS). The SCK, MISO, and MOSI lines were connected to Arduino pins 13, 12, and 11, respectively.
                            We also assigned the SS pin for SPI communication to be digital pin 4 on the Arduino. In order for the Arduino to
                            send data to the FPGA, the SS line needed to be set to low and kept low for the duration of the communication period.
                            Data was sent from the Arduino to the FPGA on the MOSI line. Hence, the Arduino was the master and the FPGA was the
                            slave. Three of the four Arduino pins connected to the FPGA needed to go through a voltage divider first to step the voltage
                            down from 5V (the output voltage of the arduino digital pins) to 3.3V (the input voltage of the GPIO pins on the FPGA)
                            by using 330 Ohm and 680 Ohm resistors. The only line that did not need to go through a voltage divider was the MISO
                            line because its voltage was determined by the GPIO pin on the FPGA that was acting as the output.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            An important discovery that we made during testing was that the MISO line was disrupting our radio communication
                            between Arduinos. However, the MISO line was technically never used because we only communicated from Arduino to FPGA,
                            never the other way. Therefore, we ended up disconnecting our MISO line altogether, and its interference with the
                            radio communication ended.

                            Like we mentioned in Milestone 4, we chose to subdivide the display into 10 pixel x 10 pixel squares, in order to
                            display a 5x4 maze on the screen. Using this convention, we made the wall widths 10 pixels and all the actual grid
                            spaces 80 pixels x 80 pixels. With five wall spaces and four grid spaces in the x-direction and six wall spaces and
                            five grid spaces in the y-direction, our entire maze takes up a 370 pixel x 460 pixel area on the monitor. The

                            This VGA_DRIVER module outputs to the VGA monitor like we discussed in Labs 3 and 4. The adjacent GPIO pins between
                            pins 9 and 23 on the GPIO_0 side first connect to the 8-bit DAC that we discussed for Lab 3. The DAC is then connected
                            to the VGA switch via a VGA cable.

                            The data structure that we used to store the pixel color data for the full 370 pixel x 460 pixel maze was a 37x46 array
                            that we called wall_grid. This data structure stores 3-bit values, which encode what color to assign to each 10 pixel x
                            10 pixel square. We needed 3-bits because there were 8 possible colors that could be assigned. Our final color scheme

                        <p>
                            Following Milestone 4, we encountered several issues regarding our FPGA code resulting in random pixelation on the
                            VGA display and incorrect locations being colored in. We were able to initialize and color the starting maze correctly,
                            but when we coded the Arduino to send hard-coded instruction values via SPI the problems surfaced. Our grid was colored
                            by having an always @ (*) block with combinational logic assign colors to many small pixel segments. After consulting a
                            TA, we speculated that our problems were caused by accidentally assigning colors to certain pixels multiple times in
                            the always block. To correct this issue, we decided to implement a state machine in order to separate multiple locations
                            in the code where colors were assigned to pixels. Our state machine had 8 states, and the following list indicates the
                            purpose of each state:

                        To incorporate a state machine effectively, we wanted to have our robot functions synced with the FPGA clock to avoid the possibility of floating values,
                        which likely could have been the reason for the pixelation we were experiencing. State 000 is when we reset of initialize the maze, so we use nested for loops
                        to cycle through every grid position in our entire 36x45 maze to color all node location turqoise for unvisited, the perimeter walls black to indicate the boundaries of the maze,
                        and all interior walls white since we are unsure if there is a wall there or not. We also initialize our xy- position to be at the bottom right of the maze because this is
                        a precondition of the competition. Our last position is then updated to have the xy- position value in binary to represent starting at the bottom right in our data representation scheme
                        before moving onto State 001.

                        For this state, we need to convert the 4x5 positions of the maze into a 9x11 format, which we accomplish by using the formula y' = 2y +1.
                        We then check the treasure variable we parsed before to see if there was a treasure in that grid location. Depending on the treasure variable we
                        set the current grid position in the 9x11 data_struc register to the correct color. To color to the grid, we do a series of assign statements to set the
                        corresponding positions in the 36x45 grid to the color mapped by the 9x11 grid by using the formula y' = 9(y-1)/2 + n, where n is an offset for the grid positions.

                        The only addition to our Milestone 4 scheme was to change the three previusly unused bits in the second byte to indicate when the robot has finished completing the maze via DFS.
                        When the robot completes the maze, these bits will be set to 3'b111.

                        In order for the robot to communicate with the base station Arduino, we utilized two Nordic nRF24L01 along with the RF24 Arduino library and "Getting Started" sketch within the library.
                        We initialize the Arduino pins 9 and 10 with 9 being the radio enable, while pin 10 is the SS for the SPI transfer bus. Our radios were set to transmit and receive
                        on channels 4 and 5 by use of the formula 2(3D + N) + X where D is our lab data (Monday = 0), N is our team number (Team 2 = 2), and X is either 0 or 1 to identify the two radios. Since our radio
                        transmission involves sending two bytes of data, we set the payload size to 2. There are two pipes set to allow for reading and writing with respect to the transmitting and receiving radios.

                        The Arduino at our base station is responsible for receiving the data transmitted by our robot Arduino and sending the data to the FPGA via SPI.
                        To receive, the code is very similar to the radio transmit code, but on the receive end we are only responsible for checking when data is sent and preparing
                        it in a 16 bit format to be sent to the FPGA. The SS for the radio and FPGA SS lines are manipulated in order indicate when we are sending data.

                            The robot was tested the night before the competition and worked well. Unfortunately, we dropped it and broke some parts, such as the chasis, so they needed to be replaced. Upon testing it again that night after fixing it and the morning of the competition, it was still working as well.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                          After we moved downstairs, we calibrated the servos and then reuploaded the same code we used to test the robot minutes prior and it wasn’t moving at all. The bot would begin running the algorithm and reset before running through the code. After commenting out our radio transmission code we found that it was causing issues, even though it hadn’t been in the past. We ultimately commented out the portion that recieved information back from the FPGA to ensure the payload was sent properly. Once that part was commented out, our robot would function properly again. Since there was not a lot of time to fix this issue, we could not fully diagnose the problem, but a reset of the arduino typically means there is a short somewhere in the system. Even so, we are unsure of why the code would run properly with just a few lines of code commented out that previously proved no issue.
                          </p>
                          <p>

                          During the competition, our robot was off to a good start but stopped running in the middle of the maze. We continued to reset it and tried again a few times, but it would always stop running at a different part of the maze. This led us to believe it was a problem with the battery. It Seemed like it didn’t have enough charge and was continuing to turn on and off. After charging it for a little in between rounds we ran into the same problem. We believe that perhaps our battery was damaged by shorting it or some other reason. Perhaps upon dropping it the night before something else was damage that we didn’t notice, despite it working well right up until the competition. Due to the drop, many portions of the robot had to be rewired and perhaps the wiring was not as clean as it had been in the past. Moving the robot around in the morning could have caused wires to short due to the less robust wiring done the night before. 
                        </p>

                        Below is a short video of our robot running during the second round up until the first time it reset.
